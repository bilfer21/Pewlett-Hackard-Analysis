# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to identify the both the counts and titles of retiring employees in an effort to prepare for the large organizational turnover that is anticipated as they reach retirement age. As part of the analysis, those employees who may be eligible for mentorships to help mitigate the disruption caused by large numbers of retirements were also identified.


## Results

* The analysis showed that a total of 90,398 employees were born between the years 1952 and 1955. The distribution of titles for these retiring employees is shown below:

* The results indicate that the positions of Senior Engineer and Senior Staff will see the most turnover with the anticipated retirements, with 64% of anticipated retirees holding one of these two titles.


* An analysis aimed at the identification of employees eligible for mentorship opportunities revealed 1,549 eligible employees. These employees were selected based upon a birth date falling within the year 1965. The distribution of titles for these eligible employees is shown below:

* The analysis looking at employees eligible for mentorships shows that while Senior Staff and Senior Engineer positions make up 71% of the eligible employees, the overall number of mentorships across these positions (1,098) would fall far short of the numbers of potential retirees.



## Summary

Looking at the results of the analysis, it is clear that the organization will have to face the challenge of potentially losing over 90,000 employees due to aproaching retirements. While this could present many problems in regard to organizational continuity, there is also an opportunity to utilize the experience of those employees approaching retirement. With the large number of potential retirees that could act as mentors, it may be prudent to expand the mentorship opportunites by including employees born over a larger period of time. This may serve to prepare a larger number of younger employees to step into senior roles and potentially minimize the impact from the large number of retirees.
